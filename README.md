A NFT marketplace that also provides the canvas. I believe that anyone should be able to be creative no matter their financial situation. No need for expensive software or hardware. All you need is a web browser and you can get creative.

## Setup
In the repository directory run ``` npm install ``` to install all dependencies 

and

```npm start``` to start the react project
